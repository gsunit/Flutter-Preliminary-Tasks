## Flutter Preliminary Tasks

### Instructions
- [ ] Fork this repo.
- [ ] Install Flutter on your laptop.
- [ ] Create and run a new app (either using an emulator, or in your own device).
- [ ] Upload the contents of the app on your forked Github repository.
- [ ] Create a new issue on the [original repo](https://github.com/gsunit/Flutter-Preliminary-Tasks/issues). Copy the contents of this README and paste it inside the issue so that you can tick the tasks that you have completed.
- [ ] Start working on the app.

### Useful suggestions
- You might want to learn the basics of `git` first if you don't know it already.
- I'll be checking the progress in the issues, so keep checking the items in `Instructions`, `Task Description` & `Reading Material` as you complete them.
- <strong> It is not necessary to complete all the tasks. </strong> Complete as many as you can.
- The links to the resources in the `Reading Material` sections are just suggestions. All that matters is that you are familiar with the mentioned topics. Feel free to Google the topics on your own (which I recommend) and, say, read a `Medium` article instead.

### Task description
- [ ] Link a new Firebase Project with your Flutter app.
- [ ] Setup Google Sign-In in your app.
- [ ] Feed data into `Firestore` and display in app using `StreamBuilder` widget.
- [ ]  Store user's `Name`, `Profile Pic`, `Email ID` in a `users` document in `Firestore`& create a basic profile page displaying the stored info.
